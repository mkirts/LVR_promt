This is the completed prompt for LVG.

When inspecting the project, please use the "index.html" file. As all of the content is in there. 
As per instructions, the webpage:
1) Contains all of the content from the other HTML files along with other edits
2) Was created as closely to the mockup as possible.

Features:
- Responsive design: the site will readjust the viewport when resizing, and has a responsive layout for when the user is on mobile
- Quick menu: the top bar menu (which was originally used to lead to other pages) has been repurposed as a "quick menu" bar. This will take the users to specific parts of the page
- Adjustments to site: The site has some additional adjustments to both the style and the fonts. These adjustments include changes to font sizes, font families (according to the prompt, Hiragino Sans was being used, though I switched to Noto Sans JP).

NOTE: Minor edits will still be made until 1700 Hours on June 1 HST (1200 Hours on June 2 JST).
